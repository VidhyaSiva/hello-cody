My version of hello world

Hi Humans!
   My name is Cody. I am a labrodor retriever born on June 8th, 2011.
   I lived one of the happiest lives better than any human or dog can.
   I loved my human sivakumar family so much that I miss them so much as an angel.
   I can't wait to be born again in the Sivakumar family again - may be this time in Superior, CO.
   See you there soon, because I love humans a lot.
